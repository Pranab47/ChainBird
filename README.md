This is a decentralized Social Media built on top of Lens protocol and ipfs.
We're keeping all the features of normal twitter but on a _decentralized architecture_ .

To get started, do the following :

- install all the dependeecies with `npm install` or `yarn install`

To run the project, type `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` in your terminal. Now your project is running on http://localhost:3000

In order to be able to create profiles and post content, you'll need to set up a _.env_ .
Inside that file, set your storage key like this `NEXT_PUBLIC_STORAGE_KEY= `.

ðŸš¨ The storage key in this case will be the key that we generate from [web3.storage](https://web3.storage/) which is a service for storing data on IPFS.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»
